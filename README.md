Ball-in-maze
============

Cocos3D for iPhone with Bullet physics integration.

- Uses the Blender 3D model from https://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6649
- No game logic just physcis interaction
- Updates the gravity in the physics simulation from the device accelerometer just like the real maze.
- No Bullet physics wrapper, the physics world creation and update is just like the Cocos2D Box template in Xcode.
- The project is the hello world Cocos 3D template adding support to load .POD and .bullet files exported from Blender using PVRGeoPOD exporter add-on and the built-in physics exporter
