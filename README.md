============

Cocos3D for iPhone with Blender model and Bullet physics simulation.

- Uses the Blender 3D model from https://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6649
- No game logic just loads the model from a .blend file and the physics simulation the .bullet file.
- Uses CoreMotion to update the gravity in the physics simulation.
- Updated to Cocos3D 2.x and Bullet 2.82
