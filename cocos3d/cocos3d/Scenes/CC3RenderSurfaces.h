/**
 * Indicates the number of faces of the cube-map that will be generated on each invocation
 * of the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: method.
 * 
 * Generating each face in the cube-map requires rendering the scene from the perspective of
 * a camera facing towards that face, and generating a full cube-map requires six separate
 * scene renderings. Depending on the complexity of the scene, this can be quite costly.
 *
 * However, in most situations, an environment map does not require high-fideility, and the
 * workload can be spread over time by not generating all of the cube-map faces on every snapshot.
 *
 * You can use this property to control the number of cube-map faces that will be generated each
 * time a snapshot is taken using the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: method.
 *
 * The maximum value of this property is 6, indicating that all six faces should be generated
 * each time the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: method is invoked.
 * Setting this property to a smaller value will cause fewer faces to be generated on each
 * snapshot, thereby spreading the workload out over time. On each invocation, a different set
 * of faces will be generated, in a cycle, ensuring that each face will be generated at some point.
 *
 * As an example, setting this value to 2 will cause only 2 of the 6 faces of the cube-map to
 * be generated each time the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: is invoked.
 * Therefore, it would take 3 snapshot invocations to generate all 6 sides of the cube-map.
 *
 * You can even set this property to a fractional value less than one to spread the updating
 * of the faces out even further. For example, if the value of this property is set to 0.25,
 * the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: method will only generate one
 * face of this cube-map texture every fourth time it is invoked. On the other three invocations,
 * the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor: method will do nothing. Therefore,
 * with the value of this property set to 0.25, it would take 24 snapshot invocations to generate
 * all 6 sides of this cube-map.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is 1, indicating that one face of the cube-map will be
 * generated on each invocation of the generateSnapshotOfScene:fromGlobalLocation:withVisitor:
 * method. With this value, it will take six invocations to generate all six sides of the cube-map.
