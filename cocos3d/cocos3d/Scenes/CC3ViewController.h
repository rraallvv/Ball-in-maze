/**
 * Terminates the current use of OpenGL by this application.
 *
 * Releases the object in the controlledNode property, releases the view of this controller,
 * ends the CCDirector session, terminates OpenGL and deletes all GL contexts, serving all
 * threads, and clears all caches that contain content that uses OpenGL, including:
 * 	 - CC3Resource
 *   - CC3Texture
 *   - CC3ShaderProgram
 *   - CC3Shader
 *   - CC3ShaderSourceCode
 *
 * You can invoke this method when your app no longer needs support for OpenGL, or will not
 * use OpenGL for a significant amount of time, in order to free up app and OpenGL memory 
 * used by your application.
 *
 * To ensure that that the current GL activity has finished before pulling the rug out from
 * under it, this request is queued for each existing GL context, on the thread for which 
 * the context was created, and will only be executed once any currently running tasks on 
 * the queue have been completed.
 *
 * In addition, once dequeued, a short delay is imposed, before the GL context instance is
 * actually released and deallocated, to provide time for object deallocation and cleanup
 * after the caches have been cleared, and autorelease pools have been drained. The length
 * of this delay may be different for each context instance, and is specified by the
 * CC3OpenGL deletionDelay property of each instance.
 *
 * Since much of the processing of this method is handled through queued operations, as
 * described above, this method will return as soon as the requests are queued, and well
 * before the operations have completed, and OpenGL has been terminated.
 *
 * You can choose to be notified once all operations triggered by this method have completed,
 * and OpenGL has been terminated, by registering a delegate object using the CC3OpenGL 
 * setDelegate: class method. The delegate object will be sent the didTerminateOpenGL method
 * once  all operations triggered by this method have completed, and OpenGL has been terminated.
 * You should use this delegate notification if you intend to make use of OpenGL again, as you
 * must wait for one OpenGL session to terminate before starting another.
 *
 * Note that, in order to ensure that OpenGL is free to shutdown, this method forces the
 * CC3Texture shouldCacheAssociatedCCTexture2Ds class-side property to NO, so that any
 * background loading that is currently occurring will not cache cocos2d textures. 
 * If you had set this property to YES, and intend to restart OpenGL at some point, then
 * you might want to set it back to YES before reloading 3D resources again.
 *
 * Use this method with caution, as creating the GL contexts again will require significant overhead.
