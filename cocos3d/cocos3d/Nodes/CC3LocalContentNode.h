/**
 * CC3LocalContentNode is an abstract class that forms the basis for nodes
 * that have local content to draw.
 *
 * You can cause a wireframe box to be drawn around the local content of
 * the node by setting the shouldDrawLocalContentWireframeBox property to YES.
 * This can be particularly useful during development to locate the boundaries
 * of a node, or to locate a node that is not drawing properly.
 * You can set the default color of this wireframe using the class-side
 * defaultLocalContentWireframeBoxColor property.

/**
 * Checks that this node is in the correct drawing order relative to other nodes.
 * This implementation forwards this notification up the ancestor chain to the CC3Scene,
 * which checks if the node is correctly positioned in the drawing sequence, and
 * repositions the node if needed.
 *
 * By default, nodes are automatically repositioned on each drawing frame to optimize
 * the drawing order, so you should usually have no need to use this method.
 * 
 * However, in order to eliminate the overhead of checking each node during each drawing
 * frame, you can disable this automatic behaviour by setting the allowSequenceUpdates
 * property of specific drawing sequencers to NO.
 *
 * In that case, if you modify the properties of a node or its content, such as mesh or material
 * opacity, and your CC3Scene drawing sequencer uses that criteria to sort nodes, you can invoke
 * this method to force the node to be repositioned in the correct drawing order.
 *
 * You don't need to invoke this method when initially setting the properties.
 * You only need to invoke this method if you modify the properties after the node has
 * been added to the CC3Scene, either by itself, or as part of a node assembly.

/**
 * Indicates whether the node should display a wireframe box around the local content
 * of this node.
 *
 * This property is distinct from the inherited shouldDrawWireframeBox property.
 * The shouldDrawWireframeBox property draws a wireframe that encompasses this node
 * and any child nodes, where this property draws a wireframe that encompasses just
 * the local content for this node alone. If this node has no children, then the two
 * wireframes will surround the same volume.
 *
 * The wireframe box is drawn by creating and adding a CC3WireframeBoundingBoxNode as a child node
 * to this node. The dimensions of the child node are set from the localContentBoundingBox
 * property of this node. Setting this property to YES adds the wireframe child node, and
 * setting this property to NO removes the wireframe child node.
 *
 * Setting this property to YES can be useful during development in determining the
 * boundaries of the local drawn content of a node.
 *
 * The color of the wireframe box will be the value of the class-side
 * defaultLocalContentWireframeBoxColor property, or the value of the color
 * property of this node if defaultLocalContentWireframeBoxColor is equal
 * to kCCC4FBlackTransparent.
